# PRD: Generic Lesson Screen for Mathematics (Ages 4–7)

## 1. Objective
Create a modular, visually engaging **lesson screen** to teach basic math concepts (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to young children. The goal is to make learning math **visual, interactive, playful, and voice-guided**, using animated objects and simple language.

---

## 2. Key Features

### 2.1 Visual Math Story
- Animated **AI Teacher (Alex)** appears on the screen explaining the problem.
- Example: “Let's add 2 🍎 + 1 🍎!”
- Visuals: Apples animate in one-by-one.

### 2.2 Problem Display Area
- Large, colorful equation display:
  - e.g., “2 + 1 = ?” shown in BIG friendly font.
- Animated objects (e.g., apples, bananas, balls) represent numbers visually.

### 2.3 Interactive Learning Zone
- Child can **tap** to count objects.
- Small hand or sparkle animation shows up as they tap each object.

### 2.4 Answer Options (MCQ Style)
- 3–4 large, rounded number buttons.
- E.g., buttons: [2] [3] [4] [5]
- Big enough for small fingers.

### 2.5 Audio Instructions
- Friendly recorded voice explains the problem.
- Example: “Can you tell me how many apples there are altogether?”

### 2.6 Correct/Incorrect Feedback
- **Correct**:
  - Confetti animation + Alex says: “Great job!”
- **Incorrect**:
  - Gentle encouragement: “Let's try again!” + Highlighted counting aid.

### 2.7 Hints & Try Again
- Optionally, after 1 wrong attempt, a “Hint” animation plays.
- Objects flash one-by-one counting together with Alex's voice.

### 2.8 Navigation Buttons
- [🏠 Home], [↩️ Back], [➡️ Next Problem]

| **Transition Animations**| Smooth fade-in/fade-out between problems; pop-in animation for objects |

---

## 4. Edge Cases Handling
- **Idle Timeout**: If user is inactive for 30 seconds, Alex prompts gently: “Are you still there? Let’s try together!”
- **Voice Control Mode**: If available, option to **say the answer** instead of tapping (speech-to-text).

---

## 5. Content Adaptability
| Math Type        | How it's Visualized  |
|------------------|-----------------------|
| Addition         | Group A + Group B merge |
| Subtraction      | Group A - Removing Group B |
| Multiplication   | Groups of objects |
| Division         | Distributing objects into equal groups |

## 6. Example Flow

1. Alex: “Let’s solve 2 + 3!”
2. 2 🍎 + 3 🍎 appear on screen.
3. Big equation “2 + 3 = ?”
4. Child taps [5] button.
5. 🎉 Stars burst animation + Alex: “You got it!”
6. [Next Problem] button appears.

## 7. Platform Adaptation
- **Tablet and Mobile**: Same experience with slight padding changes.
- **Web Browser**: Wider layout, but centered interaction area.

---

## 8. Future Enhancements
- Unlock different **object themes**: e.g., underwater animals, space items.
- Adaptive difficulty: Slightly harder problems if child answers correctly many times.
- Customizable AI Teachers (different characters).
