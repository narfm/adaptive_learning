# 📋 PRD for Age/Grade Selection Screen

---

## 🎯 Purpose:
- Quickly and visually let the user (or their parent) **select their age or grade**.
- Drive how the rest of the app adapts (teaching style, UI, voice tone, difficulty).
- **Must feel friendly** to both very young kids (5 years old) **and** mature enough for teens (14+).

```

| [ App Logo Top Left ]         [ Settings Icon ]|

|                                                |
+------------------------------------------------+
```

## 🛠️ UI Elements:

| Element                    | Details |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| **Header Title**            | “How old are you?” or “Choose your grade” in **large, bold, friendly font**. |
| **Age Selection Buttons**   | Large, rounded, colorful buttons with **ages (5, 6, 7...14+)**. |
| **Grade Selection Buttons** | Alternative view: "1st Grade", "2nd Grade" etc. Maybe toggleable. |
| **Icons on Buttons**        | Optional: Small icon of a book, backpack, etc., beside the number. |
| **Parent/Teacher Mode**     | Small clickable link for adults configuring the app for a child. |
| **Settings Icon**           | Top right, small gear icon for quick access to language, audio settings. |

---

## 🎨 Style Guide:

| Item        | Spec |
|-------------|------|
| Font        | Rounded, friendly, easy-to-read. |
| Colors      | Bright but not neon. Use color coding by age group if possible (example: lighter colors for younger kids). |
| Button Size | Large touch targets for small fingers (min 48x48px). |
| Icons       | Simple and intuitive (no complicated details). |

---

## 🔥 Behavior:

| Action                      | Result |
|------------------------------|--------|
| Tap on Age                   | App stores selected age → Proceeds to **personalized onboarding**. |
| Tap on Grade                 | Same flow — app sets grade → Moves to onboarding. |
| Tap "Parent/Teacher"         | App navigates to a **Setup Mode** (config options for kids). |
| Tap Settings Icon            | Opens **Settings Drawer** without leaving page. |

**Transitions**: 
- Fun animations when selecting age (button bounce or glow).
- Smooth fade or slide to the next screen.

---

## 🧠 Intelligence:

- If age is **5–7** → Use **younger kid-friendly UI**, voice, examples.
- If age is **8–10** → Adjust language to slightly more mature but still playful.
- If age is **11–14** → Mature tone, more detailed learning, complex examples.

Stored preferences could look like:

```json
{
  "userAge": 8,
  "userGrade": "3rd",
  "uiLevel": "child",
  "difficultyProfile": "early-elementary"
}
```

## 🧪 Edge Cases:

| Case                                | Handling |
|-------------------------------------|----------|
| User doesn’t pick an age/grade      | Disable "Next" button until selection is made. |
| Wrong selection (mis-tap)           | Allow immediate change — no "Confirm" needed. |
| Very young child (understanding difficulty) | Let Parent/Teacher Mode intervene easily. |

---

## 🛠️ Technical Notes for Flutter:

- Use `GridView` or `Wrap` layout for Age and Grade buttons.
- Use responsive sizing (`MediaQuery`) to handle mobile vs. web views.
- Local asset images/icons for offline speed.
- Save selected age/grade using `Provider`, `Riverpod`, or simple local storage (`shared_preferences`).
