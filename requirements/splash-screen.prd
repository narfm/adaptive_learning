Alright, let's zoom in **only** on the **Splash Screen** and define it in detail:

# üéØ Splash Screen Specification

### 1. Purpose:
- Create an immediate, **friendly**, **inviting**, and **child-appropriate** welcome.
- Establish the **brand** (fun + learning) quickly.
- Smoothly transition into age selection/home screen after a few seconds or tap.

### 2. Visual Layout:

| **Loading Indicator** | Simple animated spinner, progress bar, or playful animation (bouncing ball, floating stars). |
| **Audio (optional)** | A short friendly sound (e.g., gentle chime or mascot saying ‚ÄúHello!‚Äù).                  |

### 4. Timing and Behavior:

| Behavior                      | Details                                                      |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Duration**                   | Display for 2‚Äì4 seconds or until assets are loaded.          |
| **Skip Option**                | Optional: Tap anywhere to skip immediately to next screen.   |
| **Auto-Navigation**            | Automatically transition to **Age/Grade Selection** screen. |

---

### 5. Animations:

- **Fade In** the background first (0.5s).
- **Bounce In** the mascot after 0.5s.
- **Slide Up** app name and tagline after 1s.
- **Pulse** or subtle animation on loading spinner.

---

### 6. Flutter Implementation Notes:

- **Use**: `SplashScreen`, `Lottie`, or a simple `AnimatedContainer` with custom animations.
- **Packages** to consider:
  - `lottie`
  - `animated_splash_screen`
- **Ensure** that assets (mascot, sounds) are preloaded efficiently to prevent delays.

### üé® Example Color Palette:

- Background: `#C9E4FF` (light sky blue)
- Primary Accent: `#FFB703` (gold/yellow)
- Secondary Accent: `#219EBC` (medium blue)
- Text: Dark gray or navy (`#023047`)
