# PRD: AI Teacher Introduction Screen

## 1. Purpose
The AI Teacher Introduction Screen is the first personalized touchpoint after a user selects their age/grade. It introduces a friendly AI teacher character who sets the tone for the learning experience by welcoming the user and briefly introducing the learning journey.

## 2. User Stories
- As a 5-year-old user, I want a fun, animated character to greet me warmly so I feel excited to learn.
- As an 8th-grade user, I want a cooler, slightly more mature character to explain what I’ll be learning in a way I can relate to.
- As a parent, I want my child to immediately feel comfortable, engaged, and safe.

## 3. Features
| Feature | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| Animated AI Teacher Avatar | A character (different styles depending on age/grade) animated to wave, smile, and talk (lip sync or simple gestures). |
| Text Bubble + Voiceover | Friendly greeting with matching animated text bubble and clear voice narration. |
| Age-Appropriate Messaging | Short, engaging welcome message tuned to the selected age group/grade. |
| Name Personalization | If name input is available, the AI teacher addresses the user by their name ("Hi, Lily!"). |
| Background Animation | Light, non-distracting animated background like floating stars, classroom scene, or nature depending on theme. |
| "Let's Start" Button | A large, colorful button for the user to proceed to the first lesson/topic. |
| Auto-Continue Timer (optional) | If no input is given for 10 seconds, soft animation reminds user to tap "Let's Start." |

## 4. Age/Grade Adaptation
| Age Group | Style | Tone of Voice | Avatar Look |
|:---------|:------|:--------------|:------------|
| 4–7 Years | Very colorful, cartoonish | High-energy, very friendly, playful | Bright, childlike, big expressive eyes |
| 8–11 Years | Still colorful but slightly more mature | Friendly, slightly informative | Cartoon but a little cooler look |
| 12–14 Years | Semi-realistic or stylized cool | Friendly but respectful, not too childish | Teen-friendly casual avatar (hoodie, backpack, etc.) |
