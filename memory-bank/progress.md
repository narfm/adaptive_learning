- ⏳ Science lessons with interactive experiments
- ⏳ Language and reading activities
- ⏳ Art and creativity modules

### User Management
- ⏳ Enhanced user profiles with learning preferences
- ⏳ Multiple user support for families
- ⏳ Progress tracking across subjects and topics
- ⏳ Achievement and reward system

### Advanced Features
- ⏳ Voice narration for instructions and feedback
- ⏳ Speech recognition for answer input
- ⏳ Adaptive difficulty based on performance
- ⏳ Parent/teacher dashboard for progress monitoring
- ⏳ Customizable learning paths

### Technical Enhancements
- ⏳ Backend integration for content management
- ⏳ User data synchronization across devices
- ⏳ Analytics for learning patterns and effectiveness
- ⏳ Localization for multiple languages

## Known Issues

### User Interface
1. Default app name (`flutter_application_1`) needs updating
2. Some placeholder assets need replacement
3. UI scaling on certain device sizes needs refinement

### Performance
1. Animation performance may be suboptimal on lower-end devices
2. Sound playback occasionally has latency issues
3. Memory usage during extended sessions needs optimization

### Functionality
1. User profile persistence needs more robust error handling
2. Difficulty adjustment needs fine-tuning based on user testing
3. Idle timeout detection may be too sensitive/not sensitive enough

## Recent Progress

### Last Sprint Achievements
- Completed the basic math lesson screen with example and problem modes
- Implemented all four basic math operations with visual representations
- Added sound effects for user interactions and feedback
- Implemented the animated mascot with different states
- Added idle timeout detection and re-engagement

### Current Sprint Goals
- Complete sound implementation for all operations
- Add more object types for visualization variety
- Refine animation timing for better educational impact
- Improve visual feedback for user interactions
- Begin work on progress tracking

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Approach vs. Current Direction
- **Initial**: Focus on a wide range of subjects with basic implementations
- **Current**: Deep focus on math fundamentals before expanding to other subjects

- **Initial**: Simple animations for visual appeal
- **Current**: Educational animations that clearly demonstrate concepts

- **Initial**: Standard UI for all age groups
- **Current**: Age-adaptive UI with different approaches for different age ranges

### Pivots and Adjustments
1. **Example-First Approach**: Added the example mode to show concepts before problem-solving
   - Rationale: User testing showed young children needed to see concepts demonstrated

2. **Enhanced Audio Feedback**: Expanded the audio system beyond basic effects
   - Rationale: Sound effects significantly improved engagement and understanding

3. **Idle Detection**: Added timeout and re-engagement features
   - Rationale: Young users were easily distracted during testing

## Next Milestones

### Short-term (1-2 Weeks)
- Complete all planned enhancements to the Basic Math Lesson
- Implement basic progress tracking
- Add more object types and visual variety
- Finalize audio implementation

### Medium-term (1-2 Months)
- Add at least one new math topic (patterns or shapes)
- Implement voice narration for instructions
- Create a simple achievement system
- Begin work on parent/teacher dashboard

### Long-term (3-6 Months)
- Expand to at least one non-math subject
- Implement adaptive difficulty based on performance
- Add user data synchronization
- Create customizable learning paths
