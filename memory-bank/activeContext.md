# Active Context: BrightMind Adaptive Learning App

## Current Development Focus

The current development focus is on the **Basic Math Lesson** feature, which provides interactive math learning experiences for young children (ages 4-7). This feature includes:

1. **Example Mode**: Animated demonstrations of math operations
2. **Problem Mode**: Interactive problem-solving with visual aids
3. **Audio Feedback**: Sound effects for interactions and feedback
4. **Adaptive Difficulty**: Content adjusted based on user age/grade

## Recent Implementations

### Basic Math Lesson Screen
- Implemented the `BasicMathLessonScreen` with two modes:
  - Example Mode: Shows step-by-step animated examples
  - Problem Mode: Interactive problem-solving
- Added support for all four basic operations:
  - Addition: Objects appearing and combining
  - Subtraction: Objects disappearing
  - Multiplication: Groups of objects appearing
  - Division: Objects being distributed into equal groups
- Implemented the animated mascot (Alex) with different states:
  - Idle: Default state
  - Thinking: When considering or explaining
  - Happy: When user answers correctly
  - Waving: When idle timeout occurs

### Audio System
- Implemented `AudioService` for sound playback
- Added sound effects for:
  - Counting objects
  - Correct/incorrect answers
  - Object animations
  - Operation-specific sounds
  - UI interactions
- Added audio toggle functionality

### User Profile Management
- Implemented basic user profile storage using SharedPreferences
- Added age-based difficulty adjustment
- Created fallback mechanisms for missing profile data

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### UI/UX Decisions
1. **Example-First Approach**: Show animated examples before asking problems
   - Rationale: Young children learn better by seeing concepts demonstrated
   - Implementation: Two-phase lesson structure (example â†’ problem)

2. **Visual Object Representation**: Use familiar objects (apples, bananas, etc.)
   - Rationale: Concrete objects are easier for young children to understand
   - Implementation: Randomized object types for variety

3. **Immediate Feedback**: Show visual and audio feedback instantly
   - Rationale: Reinforces learning and maintains engagement
   - Implementation: Animation and sound effects on answer selection

4. **Hint System**: Show counting hints after incorrect attempts
   - Rationale: Guides children to correct answer without frustration
   - Implementation: Visual highlighting of objects with count animation

### Technical Decisions
1. **Animation Management**: Use explicit animation controllers
   - Rationale: Provides precise control over multi-step animations
   - Implementation: Separate controllers for different animation sequences

2. **Audio Implementation**: Preload and cache sound effects
   - Rationale: Minimizes latency for immediate feedback
   - Implementation: AudioService with sound name mapping

3. **Problem Generation**: Adjust difficulty based on user profile
   - Rationale: Provides appropriate challenge level
   - Implementation: Different number ranges for different age groups

4. **Idle Timeout Handling**: Detect and respond to user inactivity
   - Rationale: Re-engage distracted children
   - Implementation: Timer-based detection with animated prompt

## Current Challenges

1. **Animation Performance**: Ensuring smooth animations on lower-end devices
   - Approach: Optimize animation complexity and test on various devices

2. **Sound Synchronization**: Timing sound effects with visual animations
   - Approach: Use animation callbacks to trigger sounds at precise moments

3. **Difficulty Calibration**: Finding appropriate challenge levels for each age
   - Approach: Test with target age groups and adjust based on feedback

4. **Visual Clarity**: Ensuring math concepts are clearly visualized
   - Approach: Iterate on visual representations based on educational best practices

## Next Steps

### Short-term Tasks
1. Complete sound implementation for all operations
2. Refine animation timing for better educational impact
3. Add more object types for visualization variety
4. Implement progress tracking for completed problems

### Medium-term Tasks
1. Create additional math topics (patterns, shapes, comparisons)
2. Implement progressive difficulty levels
3. Add voice narration for each step
4. Create a review mode for difficult problems

### Long-term Vision
1. Expand to other subjects beyond math
2. Implement more sophisticated user profiles
3. Add parent/teacher dashboard for progress monitoring
4. Create customizable learning paths

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Code Organization
- Keep widget classes focused on single responsibilities
- Extract reusable animations into separate components
- Use constants for styling and timing values
- Document complex animation sequences

### UI Design
- Use consistent color palette from `SplashConstants`
- Maintain large touch targets for young users
- Ensure high contrast for text elements
- Use consistent animation patterns for predictability

### Educational Approach
- Always show examples before problems
- Provide multiple representations of concepts
- Give encouraging feedback, even for incorrect answers
- Allow multiple attempts with increasing guidance

## Recent Learnings & Insights

1. **Animation Sequencing**: Breaking complex animations into discrete steps improves both performance and educational clarity.

2. **Audio Importance**: Sound effects significantly enhance engagement and provide important feedback cues for young users.

3. **Idle Detection**: Young users are easily distracted, making idle detection and re-engagement important features.

4. **Visual Consistency**: Using consistent visual language across different operations helps build transferable understanding.

5. **Feedback Timing**: Immediate feedback is crucial for maintaining engagement and reinforcing learning.
