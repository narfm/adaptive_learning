# Project Brief: BrightMind Adaptive Learning App

## Overview
BrightMind is an interactive educational application built with Flutter, designed to provide adaptive learning experiences for children aged 4-16. The app uses engaging visuals, animations, and audio to teach various subjects in an age-appropriate manner.

## Core Objectives
- Create an engaging, interactive learning platform for children
- Adapt content and presentation based on the child's age and grade level
- Provide visual, interactive, and playful learning experiences
- Incorporate audio guidance and feedback
- Track progress and provide motivation through achievements

## Target Audience
- **Primary:** Children aged 4-16
- **Secondary:** Parents and teachers who want to support children's learning

## Key Features

### Age-Adaptive Interface
- Different UI/UX for younger children (4-7) vs. older children (8-16)
- Simplified, colorful interface for younger users
- More detailed, organized interface for older users

### Learning Flow
1. **Splash Screen**: App introduction
2. **Age/Grade Selection**: Personalization of content
3. **Home Screen**: Subject and topic selection
4. **AI Teacher Introduction**: Friendly character-led introduction to topics
5. **Lesson Screens**: Interactive learning content
6. **Practice Problems**: Reinforcement through interactive exercises
7. **Progress Tracking**: Achievements and learning streaks

### Interactive Elements
- Animated AI Teacher (Alex) that guides the learning experience
- Visual representations of concepts (e.g., objects for counting)
- Interactive counting and problem-solving
- Audio instructions and feedback
- Animations to demonstrate concepts

### Subject Areas
- Mathematics (currently implementing basic operations)
- Science (planned)
- History (planned)
- Art (planned)
- And more subjects to be added

## Current Focus
The current development focus is on the Basic Math Lesson screen, which teaches fundamental math operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to young children through animated examples and interactive problem-solving.

## Success Metrics
- User engagement (time spent in lessons)
- Problem-solving success rate
- Progression through topics
- User retention and return rate

## Future Vision
- Expand subject areas and depth of content
- Add more personalization options
- Implement adaptive difficulty based on performance
- Introduce more game-like elements and rewards
- Support for multiple languages
