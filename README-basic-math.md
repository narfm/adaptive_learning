# Basic Math Lesson with Animated Examples

This implementation enhances the basic math lesson screen to first show animated examples with sounds before asking the user to solve problems. It provides different visualization approaches for each operation type (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

## Features

1. **Example Mode**:
   - Shows step-by-step animated examples for each operation type
   - Includes sound effects for each step
   - Visually demonstrates how the operation works

2. **Problem Mode**:
   - Interactive problem-solving after watching the example
   - Visual counting aids
   - Sound feedback for correct/incorrect answers

3. **Operation-Specific Visualizations**:
   - **Addition**: Shows objects appearing one by one and then combining
   - **Subtraction**: Shows a group of objects with some disappearing
   - **Multiplication**: Shows groups of objects appearing
   - **Division**: Shows objects being distributed into equal groups

4. **Audio Feedback**:
   - Sound effects for each interaction
   - Different sounds for different operations
   - Audio toggle button to enable/disable sounds

## How It Works

1. When the screen loads, it starts in Example Mode
2. The animated mascot (Alex) introduces the concept
3. The example animation plays with sound effects:
   - First number appears
   - Second number appears
   - Operation is performed (combine, subtract, multiply, divide)
   - Result is shown
4. After the example, it transitions to Problem Mode
5. The user can interact with the objects and select an answer
6. Feedback is provided with sound and visual cues
7. After a correct answer, the user can move to the next problem

## Implementation Details

### Key Components

1. **ExampleAnimationDisplay**: Widget that shows the animated examples
2. **AudioService**: Service for managing sound playback
3. **BasicMathLessonScreen**: Main screen that coordinates the example and problem modes

### Sound Files

The implementation requires the following sound files in the `assets/sounds` directory:

1. `count.mp3` - Sound played when counting objects
2. `correct.mp3` - Sound played for correct answers
3. `incorrect.mp3` - Sound played for incorrect answers
4. `pop.mp3` - Sound played when objects appear
5. `slide.mp3` - Sound played during transitions
6. `combine.mp3` - Sound played during addition operations
7. `subtract.mp3` - Sound played during subtraction operations
8. `multiply.mp3` - Sound played during multiplication operations
9. `divide.mp3` - Sound played during division operations
10. `success.mp3` - Sound played when completing a problem
11. `click.mp3` - Sound played when buttons are clicked

### How to Use

1. Ensure all sound files are added to the `assets/sounds` directory
2. Navigate to the BasicMathLessonScreen with the desired operation type:
   ```dart
   Navigator.push(
     context,
     MaterialPageRoute(
       builder: (context) => BasicMathLessonScreen(
         operationType: 'Addition', // or 'Subtraction', 'Multiplication', 'Division'
         difficultyLevel: 'elementary', // or 'early-elementary'
       ),
     ),
   );
   ```

3. The screen will automatically start with an example and then transition to the problem-solving mode

### Customization

- **Difficulty Levels**: Adjust the number ranges in `_adjustDifficultyBasedOnProfile` method
- **Animation Timing**: Modify the duration values in the example animation methods
- **Visual Styles**: Update the UI components in the build methods
- **Sound Effects**: Replace the sound files with your own (keeping the same filenames)

## Future Enhancements

1. Add more object types for visualization
2. Implement progressive difficulty levels
3. Add background music options
4. Create a review mode to practice difficult problems
5. Add voice narration for each step
